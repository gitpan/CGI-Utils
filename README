NAME
     CGI::Utils - Utilities for retrieving information through the
     Common Gateway Interface

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI::Utils;
     my $utils = CGI::Utils->new;

DESCRIPTION
     This module provides an object-oriented interface for retrieving
     information provided by the Common Gateway Interface, as well as
     url-encoding and decoding values. For example, CGI has a utility
     for escaping HTML, but no public interface for url-encoding a
     value or for taking a hash of values and returning a url-encoded
     query string suitable for passing to a CGI script. This module
     does that, as well as provide methods for creating a
     self-referencing url, converting relative urls to absolute,
     adding CGI parameters to the end of a url, etc.  Please see the
     METHODS section below for more detailed descriptions of
     functionality provided by this module.

METHODS
  urlEncode($str)
     Returns the fully URL-encoded version of the given string.  It
     does not convert space characters to '+' characters.

  urlDecode($url_encoced_str)
     Returns the decoded version of the given URL-encoded string.

  urlEncodeVars($var_hash, $sep)
     Takes a hash of name/value pairs and returns a fully URL-encoded
     query string suitable for passing in a URL.  By default, uses
     the newer separator, a semicolon, as recommended by the W3C.  If
     you pass in a second argument, it is used as the separator
     between key/value pairs.

  urlDecodeVars($query_string)
     Takes a URL-encoded query string, decodes it, and returns a
     reference to a hash of name/value pairs.  For multivalued
     fields, the value is an array of values.

  getSelfRefHostUrl()
     Returns a url referencing top level directory in the current
     domain, e.g., http://mydomain.com

  getSelfRefUrl()
     Returns a url referencing the current script (without any query
     string).

  getSelfRefUrlWithQuery()
     Returns a url referencing the current script along with any
     query string parameters passed via a GET method.

  getSelfRefUrlDir()
     Returns a url referencing the directory part of the current url.

  addParamsToUrl($url, $param_hash)
     Takes a url and reference to a hash of parameters to be added
     onto the url as a query string and returns a url with those
     parameters.  It checks whether or not the url already contains a
     query string and modifies it accordingly.  If you want to add a
     multivalued parameter, pass it as a reference to an array
     containing all the values.

  getParsedCookies()
     Parses the cookies passed to the server.  Returns a hash of
     key/value pairs representing the cookie names and values.
